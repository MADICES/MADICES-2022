## Data


### Schemas/Ontologies

- [The Trouble with Ontologies, or, How to Build an Ontology](https://cthoyt.com/2020/05/12/building-an-ontology.html)

## Tools

- [Linked Data Modeling Language](https://linkml.io/): Define schema as `yaml` files and generate JSON-Schema, RDF, OWL, GraphQL, Python dataclasses
- [Versioning of data schema: Translate your data with lenses](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/): Blog posts discusses the challenges and potential solutions for dealing with evolving data schema.
