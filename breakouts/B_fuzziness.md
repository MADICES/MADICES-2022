# Fuzziness: dealing with missing data and impedance mismatch
- How do we deal with details that are missing in the experimental data but are key parts in e.g. computational data or for ML?  
- Most ELNs do not even record structured/FAIR-compliant data. How do we bring them into the loop? 
- Is there a need/place for a “FAIRification” web service? (This goes a bit along the lines of Damien’s “Archive forge”, or the frictionless data interface)
- What are the basic abstractions to characterize an experimental sample? 
    - Is it a “sample”, a “compound” and is a “compound” a mixture of “chemicals” or something completely different? 
- How are links between notebook “entries” (e.g. samples, devices, precursors, measurements, experiments, projects) represented?
