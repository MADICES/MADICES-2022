# Where are the greatest benefits to be had? And to whom? 

- What are the incentives to get started?
- Which stage of the research workflow should initial efforts be targeted at?
    - Hypothesising/expt. design
    - Data acquisition
    - Processing and analysis
    - Dissemination
    - Archiving
- What are the possible futures/user stories this could enable? For example:
    - Current researchers wanting to collaborate with others using different tools and data management systems, and publish linked data instead of raw archives
    - Future researchers trying to assess and reproduce published research, and perform metastudies, machine learning or knowledge representation
    - Software/method/tool developers, who can support a well-defined interface without reinventing the wheel, and can broadcast what they support to the community
- Interoperability approaches “biased” by requiring a critical mass on both sides of a mapping, to the exclusion of long-tail, smaller projects
