# Agility and standardization

- How do we balance the need for flexibility/agility with the need/desire for detailed, structured data? 
- We can specify and standardize up into the smallest details. However, this may render the standards completely unusable? How do we find the right balance?
- How should this technical endeavor be structured socially (c.f. Breakout #1)? Are we designing a cathedral or creating a bazaar? Can we take aspects from both?
- One of the key reasons chemists love paper notebooks is that they are flexible. How can we allow for this flexibility while still ensuring that data is reusable? 
- How ambitious are we in terms of technology?: “I like JSON-LD because it’s based on technology that most web developers use today. It helps people solve interesting distributed problems without buying into any grand vision. It helps you get to the “adjacent possible” instead of having to wait for a mirage to solidify.”
