# What is the actual problem? 

- Is the problem the lack of standards, lack of tools, or lack of motivation/incentives?
- Precious time is spent in groups discussing how we can query all this Big Data that is sure to be published via RDF instead of figuring out a way of making it easy to publish that data on the Web by leveraging common practices in use today.
    - There are already a lot of standards for experimental data. However, they are not really used.
    - For metal-organics, for instance, there is no structure editor that even allows to draw and serialize multi-center compounds, and most struggle with valenceny rules
