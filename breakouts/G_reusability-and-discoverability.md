# Making tools reusable and discoverable

- How can one make spectroscopy-related applets interoperable?  Re-implementing from scratch can be cheaper than just patching together (commercially) available solutions.
- Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could build our custom ELN by just installing relevant apps/modules from an app store? 
    - What do we need for this model, where experts from every domain contribute an app, to work 
    - How can we create a rich ecosystem in this space? Is there a clear and simple path from, say, a Python library to a serverless linked data API? How much will “modern” DevOps practices accelerate this? (e.g., “free” hosting with continuous deployment, automated and verifiable release processes)
    - How can we make it work between ELN implementations/backends? Via web-services? Are there existing technical solutions (e.g.,  mitosis), and if not, could we collectively design one? 
    - How do we split the analysis code from the visualization code and make both interoperable? 
- Refresh/review the current data management landscape with interop. in mind, building on e.g., The Labiii comparison grid of ELNs
