# Maintainability and adoption:

- How can we make sure that this project will not die and will be used? 
    - What can we learn from OPTIMADE or similar efforts (maybe, ORD, AniML)? 
    - What made the CIF a success story? 
    - What do we think about models such as the one of the Allotrope Foundation? 
    - Software user facilities in analogy to other user facilities universities have?
    - Centralization vs. collaborative custodianship (i.e., in collaborative projects [BIG-MAP, NCCR, â€¦] do we aim for one centralized data lake/store or do we only have a data registry?) 
- How do we solve the collective action problem that everyone sees the need for high-quality data, but no one wants to start sharing their data in re-usable form?
    - Do we need journals/editors to buy in? 
    - Do we need changes in education?
